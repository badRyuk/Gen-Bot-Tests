# Generator Bot
This GenBot. aka Generator Bot. This has properly coded. Uou have to just add a few accounts in to the bot. All the commands should work properly. Just insert your token in index.js.

Then run the bot using node index.js.
It has a very simple code. You can add embeds to it if you want. I don't use it anymore so i just left it so anyone can view up this code and use it in there own code if they want.

Feel free to use it in your code. You can host it on Heroku too. Hence I have added a Procfile to it. This bot is ready to use so you can just click on the green button to download the zip file.
Then extract all the files. Then you can run the code. I might be adding a few changes to the code. So stay tuned.
